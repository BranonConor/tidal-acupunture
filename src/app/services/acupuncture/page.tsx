                Acupuncture aims to restore balance in the body by stimulating
                points along meridians which coincide with areas rich in blood
                vessels, nerves, and tissue. Stimulation at these points sends
                signals that reduce inflammation, inhibit pain pathways, and
                stimulate a variety of neurotransmitters providing immediate and
                long-term relief.

              <Text as="p" mb={8}>
                This leads to benefits such as pain relief, muscle relaxation,
                anti-inflammatory effects, and immune regulation among many
                others. Acupuncture meridians have unique properties relating to
                electricity, heat, sound, light, and magnetism which are absent
                in other body areas, supporting the existence of these
                meridians.

            During acupuncture, blood vessels, mast cells, and nerve fibers are
            stimulated, sending signals to the body to reduce inflammation and
            inhibit certain pathways associated with pain. This leads to
            immediate and long-term pain relief by affecting spinal microglia
            and astrocytes. Acupuncture also influences the brain's pain
            modulation system, involving various neurotransmitters like
            endogenous opioids, serotonin, and glutamate, among others. Studies
            have indicated that acupuncture has various actions, such as
            analgesic, muscle relaxing, anti-inflammatory and antidepressant
            actions, with biological mechanisms that influence the nervous
            system, intestinal flora, immune regulation, oxidative stress, and
            neuroinflammation.
